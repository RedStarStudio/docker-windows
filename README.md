# Dockerfile for windows users
Manage, share our dockerfiles. We have a jenkins job to automatically build dockerfiles to images.
The push action will trigger the Jenkins job to build Dockerfile to docker images and push to ged-docker-l.production-cn.artifactory.bshg.com automatically.

You can call buildimages.bat by hand. 

Have fun :)
